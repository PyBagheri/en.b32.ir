Hello,

My full name is **MohammadHossein Bagheri KheirAbadi**, Yeah, It's long enough to confuse you, but it's not just a simple name, it indicates where my lineage returns to, which country I've born in and what religion I believe in. 

I've born in 2004, in a city called **Ardabil**, located in Iran. Most of people in the world love their birthplace, as well as I do, so, If I'm going to tell you about myself, first, I should tell you about a love, about a strong unbreakable connection that is beyond the bounds of descriptiveness, about my city. I'm not sure how I can transfer this feeling to you, but I'll be writing a post about this soon.

My favorite topics are the computers, education (NOT as you would think), nature and the environment, traveling around the world, languages & cultures, and some other ones. So I started this blog to write about them.

That's enough, having right cognition of someone could only be realized by knowing his thoughts, So I prefer to introduce myself in my posts rather than a simple "About page". I'm looking forward to your comments below my posts 😉.
